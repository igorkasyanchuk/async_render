Next steps:

1. Review the configuration in config/initializers/async_render.rb
   and adjust settings according to your needs.

2. Include the controller concern in your ApplicationController:

   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
     include AsyncRender::Controller
   end

3. Start using parallel rendering in your views:

   <%= async_render 'expensive_partial', locals: { user: current_user } %>

4. For more advanced usage, check out:
   - Warmup rendering for pre-loading partials
   - Memoized rendering for caching rendered content
